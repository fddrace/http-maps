# http-maps

Maps served via http download on https://maps.zillyhuhn.com

---

Upload the raw regular map files with their original name and .map extension.
They will be pulled on the zillyhuhn server by [this script](https://github.com/DDNetPP/maps-zillyhuhn.com) which then serves them at https://maps.zillyhuhn.com with the correct checksums appended.


These maps are not themes and do not have themes. If you want map themes look at this repo:
